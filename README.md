## Java Debug Hack Practice

#### Material
A tutorial of debug hacks.<br>
Link: [Java Debug Hacks (CHN)](https://iss-java.github.io/2016/09/16/Java-Debug-Hacks/)<br>
The code to practice with: [code repo](https://github.com/iss-java/DebugHack)<br>

#### Objectives
**Objective A**<br>

> Practice _adding watchpoint_, _modifying variable_, _conditional breakpoint_, _switching threads_. Note that if you are debugging the multithreaded version of code, you should combine conditional breakpoint and thread switching together. This will help you get an experience of thread execution.

**Objective B**<br>

> Answer: in function `quickMultiply`, what does a `CyclicBarrier` serve for? Why the barrier value is 5 instead of 4? What's the consequence of changing it into 4?

#### Submission

For Objective A, you are expected to make a screenshot for each debug hack, and give a short explanation of **your** purpose for each one.<br>
For both objectives, you can write them into a single document or two(doc, docx, pdf, markdown). **Append** your document(s) to your "Doubly-linked list" homework.
